# Pell's Equation
In Freek's list of theorems, the existence of non-trivial solutions to Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2=1$ was previously resolved for $d$ of the form $d = a^2-1$.
In this work, we prove the existence of non-trivial solutions to Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2=1$ in the most general setting - when $d$ is nonsquare.
