# Pell's Equation
In [Freek's list of theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/), the existence of non-trivial solutions to Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2=1$ was previously resolved for $d$ of the form $d = a^2-1$.
In this work, we prove the existence of non-trivial solutions to Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2=1$ in the most general setting - when $d$ is nonsquare.

Our formalization closely follows the proof using [Dirichlet's theorem on diophantine approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_approximation_theorem). For example, see [this](https://imomath.com/index.cgi?page=ntPellsEquationSolutions).
